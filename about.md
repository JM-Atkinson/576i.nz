# Who am I?

My name is Josh Atkinson. I'm a tech hobbyist who loves the Unix world, retro technology, and open source free software. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Auckland, and currently work for one of New Zealand's largest telecommunications providers.

I also have keen interests in personal finance, economics, politics, and cinema, so you may see content about these things from time to time (particularly the cinema part...).

# What is this site about?

This little site is essentially a wax lyrical about whatever my hobbyist experiences bring me across that I can be bothered to write about. Expect content on Unix, hardware, system administration, and occasionally some hardware restoration and other fun things.

# WTF does 576i mean?

You can find out what 576i means [here]({{site.baseurl}}/576i/).

# Where can you contact me?

I am reachable at <josh@576i.nz>, this is the best way to get in touchâ€”I actually read my emails!

If you use LinkedIn, I have one of [those](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-atkinson-4b386b193/) too.

Otherwise I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/JM-Atkinson), but I don't use it much.
