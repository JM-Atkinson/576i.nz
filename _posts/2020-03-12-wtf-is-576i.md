# WTF is 576i and what does that mean?

576i is a the display specifications for regular format PAL television. It stands for 576 lines vertically, interlaced over 50 fields.

Let's break that down. Before the days of progressive digital video like we have on all modern computers and digital television broadcasts, video for television was encoded using analog standards. There were/are three competing standards for this â€” NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. SECAM is essentially a slightly modified PAL, so there are two major standards at play here.

### NTSC or PAL?

Much like which countries drive on which side of the road, wether countries use NTSC or PAL largely depends on their neighbors, and their desired marketability for products they make to be used in other countries.

Let's have a look at the NTSC and PAL distribution world wide:

As we can see, NTSC dominates in northern, central, and the top half of southern America, and also Japan, which is notable. PAL and its close cousin SECAM dominates everywhere else. If you use the same display standard as your neighbor, this makes it very easy for you to share video products across your markets. You can exchange tapes and video recordings to broadcast on TV. Your game console systems have interchangeable games. So why not make it so everything can use both?

Unfortunately, when you have a standard, everything has to adapt to the standard for the processing chain to work. In a PAL environment, Your video tape is PAL, the VCR is PAL, and your TV is also PAL. If you make a swapping VCR, then you also need multi-format tapes, and a swapping TV as well. This is a huge cost for the consumer, and a huge cost to the industry. As far as the situation was in NTSC and PAL's hey-day, it was just too hard. 

It's _possible_, but not straight-forward to convert between the systems, and video quality is lost in the process, plus, next to no consumer devices are actually able to do this. A PAL game console plays PAL games. A PAL VCR records and plays back PAL video. In recent years we are able to convert with consumer PCs, but we don't use PAL and NTSC now, so its usefulness is passed its used-by date.

### How is this
